# JavaScriptCSSMediaQueries
Simple JavaScript and CSS media query sync tool

Tool is still underdevelopment. JS uses getComputedStyles and reads a psuedo conent value from the CSS to sync the JS and the media queries. I need to add events that fire and test in browsers. This is not ready to be used.
